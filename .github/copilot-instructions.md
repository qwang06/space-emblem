We develop video games using Godot Engine version 4.3 or later, primarily scripting in GDScript.

Our coding standards include:
- Use snake_case for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Indent code using tabs with tab size 2.
- Include type annotations for all variables and function return types.
- Utilize the `@export` keyword for inspector-exposed variables.

When providing code examples or suggestions:
- Use Godot's built-in classes and methods, such as `Node`, `Resource`, and `Signal`.
- Demonstrate best practices for game development within the Godot Engine.
- Ensure compatibility with Godot 4.3 features and APIs.

Our team emphasizes clean, modular, and well-documented code. Please include comments explaining complex logic and decisions in your code suggestions.
